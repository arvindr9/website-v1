          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>Hello! My name is Arvind, I am
            a rising freshman at Georgia Tech. I plan to major in
            discrete mathematics and computer science.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class='text'>
          <h2>Interests</h2>
          <p>I have a passion in artificial intelligence and am
          currently working on a neural network. Aside from that, I have an interest in
          mathematics (especially in the field of combinatorics) and especially
          enjoy participating in math contests like ARML. And of course, the limitless nature of
          HTML and CSS fascinates me.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='text'>
          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p><ul>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: I completed the Machine Learning
                        course by the Stanford professor Andrew Ng. I now have knowledge
                        of supervised learning algorithms (regression, neural networks, SVMs)
                        and unsupervised learning algorithms (K-means clustering, Principal Component
                        Analysis).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mathematics</strong>: I have participated in math competitions like ARML
              (American Regions Mathematics League) in high school, and as a president of my
              school's math team, I have been very involved in math. I am particularly interested
              by fields of discrete mathematics like combinatorics and number theory.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Web development</strong>: I have familiarity with HTML and CSS, as can evidently be seen by looking at my website!
              I also know Javascript and AngularJS and am currently learning Bootstrap and ReactJS.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mobile App Development</strong>: I helped create the <emph>Science Bowl</emph> app for <emph>Outplayed Apps</emph>.
              The app was built with the Ionic framework, which used HTML, CSS, JS and AngularJS.
            </li>
            <li><strong>General programming</strong>: I have experience in Java, having taken AP Computer Science.
              Now, I am learning how to incorporate GUIs into Java projects and am taking a course on algorithms
              from Princeton University on Coursera. I also have experience in the Python programming language.
            </li>
            <li>Violin</li>I have played the violin since 4th grade (in 2008) and started private lessons in 8th grade (2012).
              I played in the Georgia All-State Orchestra in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and was a member of the nationally recognized
              Atlanta Symphony Orchestra in the 2016-2017 season.
